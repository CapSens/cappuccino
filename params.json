  "body": "## Cappuccino\r\nCappuccino is a [Go](https://golang.org) project that helps developers to avoid doing repetitive tasks by defining a structured `.cappuccino.yml` config file.\r\n\r\nRobots should do the hard work, that's why a config file can contain from few to dozens of actions requiring executing commands, renaming, searching and replacing, generating from templates and more. Cappuccino is written in Go and is thus executable on all plateforms, without a need for an `LLVM` or an interpreter.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n```\r\nsudo curl -sSo /usr/bin/cappuccino https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CapSens/cappuccino/master/cappuccino && sudo chmod 777 /usr/bin/cappuccino\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example of use\r\nLet's say we need to clone a [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) git repository and apply the following changes :\r\n- Rename the `database.yml.example` file into `database.yml`.\r\n- Delete `Procfile` and `bower.json` files.\r\n- Substitute user defined variables in both `.ruby-version` and `.ruby-gemset` files.\r\n- Create the gemset using `RVM`.\r\n- Bundle install, create, migrate and seed the database.\r\n\r\nFirst, here is what the config file would look like :\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nengine: cappuccino\r\nactions:\r\n  - name: Copying database config file\r\n    type: copy\r\n    content:\r\n      - source: config/database.yml.example\r\n        destination: config/database.yml\r\n  - name: Deleting not needed files\r\n    type: delete\r\n    content:\r\n      - path: Procfile\r\n      - path: bower.json\r\n  - name: Replacing variables with their respective content\r\n    type: substitute\r\n    content:\r\n      - variable: gemset\r\n        path: .ruby-gemset\r\n        value: app_dev\r\n      - variable: version\r\n        path: .ruby-version\r\n        value: ruby-2.2.4\r\n  - name: Running bundle & using current gemset\r\n    type: exec\r\n    content:\r\n      - command: rvm use .\r\n      - command: gem install bundler\r\n      - command: bundle\r\n  - name: Setting up database, migrations and seeds\r\n    type: exec\r\n    content:\r\n      - command: bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate\r\n      - command: bundle exec rake db:seed\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe config file should be placed in the root of the git repository to be detected and parsed by `cappuccino`. Once done, you can call the following command :\r\n```\r\ncappuccino -g git@github.com:username/reponame.git -b master\r\n```\r\n\r\n`-b master` is optional as the master branch is selected by default. Once the above command executed, `cappuccino` will clone the repository and apply the defined actions.\r\n\r\n### Important\r\n- If an action is a `substitution` and the variable name is `gemset`, cappuccino will search and find `[cappuccino-var-gemset]` in the repository and substitute it with related value.\r\n- Both `substitution` and `replace` action types accept a `indent` key that informs `cappuccino` to indent the string or block by the desired nombre of spaces.\r\n- The `path` key is optional but recommended; not defining it will force a [Depth-first Search Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) on the whole repository.\r\n\r\n### Currently available action types:\r\n* _exec_, executes the given command with full list of arguments.\r\n* _copy_, copies a file from source to destination.\r\n* _move_, moves a file from source to destination.\r\n* _replace_, replaces a string in a specified path or parses the whole repository.\r\n* _substitute_, replaces cappuccino defined variables by their proper definition.\r\n* _delete_, deletes a file.\r\n\r\n### Upcoming features:\r\n* Substitution with GPG encryption/decryption on the fly.\r\n* Ability to call [Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/vault.html) and retreive confidential information.\r\n* Ability to call Amazon S3 for automatic bucket creation and credentials retrieval.\r\n* Ability to call and execute a remote .cappuccino.yml config file.\r\n* Compilable config file for semantic format analysis.\r\n* Custom user defined types.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n```\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2016 CapSens S.A.S\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
