  "body": "## Cappuccino\r\nCappuccino is a [Go](https://golang.org) project that aims to help developers avoid doing repetitive tasks by defining a structured `.cappuccino.yml` config file.\r\n\r\nBecause robots should do the hard work, a typical config file can contain from few to dozens of actions requiring executing commands, renaming, searching and replacing, generating from templates and more. Cappuccino is written in Go and is thus executable on all plateforms, without a need for an `LLVM` or an interpreter.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n```\r\nsudo curl -sSo /usr/bin/cappuccino https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CapSens/cappuccino/master/cappuccino && sudo chmod 777 /usr/bin/cappuccino\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example of config file\r\n```yaml\r\nengine: cappuccino\r\nactions:\r\n  - name: Copying database config file\r\n    type: copy\r\n    content:\r\n      - source: config/database.yml.example\r\n        destination: config/database.yml\r\n  - name: Moving Licence file to Licence.back\r\n    type: move\r\n    content:\r\n      - source: LICENSE\r\n        destination: LICENSE.back\r\n  - name: Deleting not needed files\r\n    type: delete\r\n    content:\r\n      - path: Procfile\r\n      - path: bower.json\r\n  - name: Setting up database, migrations and seeds\r\n    type: exec\r\n    content:\r\n      - command: bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate\r\n      - command: bundle exec rake db:seed\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Currently available action types:\r\n* _exec_, executes the given command with full list of arguments.\r\n* _copy_, copies a file from source to destination.\r\n* _move_, moves a file from source to destination.\r\n* _replace_, replaces a string in a specified path or by parsing the whole repository.\r\n* _substitute_, replaces cappuccino defined variables by their proper definition.\r\n* _delete_, deletes a file.\r\n\r\n### Upcoming features:\r\n* Substitution with GPG encryption/decryption on the fly.\r\n* Ability to call [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) and retreive confidential information.\r\n* Compilable config file for semantic format analysis.\r\n* Custom user defined types.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n```\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2016 CapSens S.A.S\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
